# My connection to IGN 
I want to express my interest in participating in your Code Foo program. As a graduate student majoring in Information Systems at Northeastern University, I have always been fascinated about programming and latest technology solutions. I have long held the belief that information technology has the power to enhance people's lives in myriad ways, whether it be physical or psychological. By simply redesigning the user experience, we can alleviate the user's psychological burden and even bring joy to their daily interactions with our products. Whenever I ponder this idea, I find myself exhilarated and motivated to deepen my knowledge. My ultimate aspiration is to create a product that users will embrace and that truly embodies the spirit of "From Hello World to Change the World.". 

My formal introduction to the gaming industry began with my one-year internship in 2019 in the LINE Game Technical department. During this time, I was primarily responsible for developing internal management tools for GMs, as well as assisting the marketing team with the creation of campaign products, such as event websites or Chatbots. However, the most fulfilling aspect of my internship was working on the development of the customer loyalty platform, LINE GAME University, which boasts over 100,000 users. Through this project, I became more proficient in Vue.js web development and REST API. This experience solidified my decision to pursue a career in this industry and commit myself to its continued growth and development.

Prior to my internship in the game industry, I had been a longtime follower of IGN. This esteemed platform consistently produces high-quality and authentic reviews that I have come to rely on when making purchasing decisions. Several games that have earned a perfect 10 rating have provided me with an unforgettable gaming experience. As a result, IGN has remained at the top of my bookmarks, and I frequently visit the site. The thought of being able to work for this platform is truly exhilarating and has been a long-standing dream of mine.

During the peak of Wordle's popularity, I was studying object-oriented programming in JAVA and had just familiarized myself with JavaFX, an integrated user interface tool. Intrigued by the game, I endeavored to create a replica version of Wordle from scratch using JavaFX. I incorporated both four and six-word versions, allowing players to adjust the number of lines to be guessed to increase or decrease difficulty levels. This experience taught me a valuable lesson: the most challenging aspect of any successful project is not the actual implementation but rather the planning and promotion. Furthermore, I discovered that the logic behind Wordle itself is relatively simple to understand after creating it, although there are a few tricky areas that require careful consideration. This project allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the significant impact that effective promotion can have on a great game.

Based on the previous discussion, it may seem logical for me to pursue a career as a game developer. However, after gaining a deep understanding of the game industry over the years, I have come to realize that there is a plethora of outstanding games already on the market. Many of these games are just one step away from becoming truly exceptional and merely lack a final puzzle piece to bring them to the next level. My prior experience as an intern in the game technology department has further solidified my belief that I would find great satisfaction in playing a role in bringing these games to the public. By assuming a position that does not overly influence the product's development process, but instead focuses on delivering exceptional work to consumers, I am fulfilling my aspirations. IGN is the ideal platform for me to achieve this lifelong dream of mine.

# Why should you pick me to participate in IGNâ€™s Code-Foo program?
IGN Code-Foo believes that finding extraordinary people in unusual places is more important than ever. The two essential qualities required for this job are programming skills and a genuine passion for the industry. I believe that I possess both of these qualities and am the perfect fit for the role. My passion for programming and the gaming industry is evident, and I thoroughly enjoy staying abreast of the latest technologies. This year's Code-Foo questions were particularly challenging and intriguing, and although I encountered difficulties working with new technologies such as MongoDB and React, I persevered and demonstrated my ability to quickly adapt and learn. Moreover, I am a team player and believe that the collaborative environment of Code-Foo program allowed us to coordinate our ideas effectively and provide direction. I am confident that with continued hard work, I will achieve my goals and IGN will be the gateway to my success.
