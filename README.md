## Hisui's New Power Plant
The Galaxy Team has decided that in order to advance the research on Pokemon and the Pokedex, Jubilife village needs a brand new power plant. Luckily, Professor Laventon has discovered that the Pokemon, Voltorb, is the best candidate to help power the village.

Voltorbs can cleanly and efficiently produce electricity. An average Voltorb is about 0.5m (1'08") tall and weighs 10.4 kg (22.8lbs). However, they are uncommon and are only found in the Sacred Plaza.

Objective: How many Voltorbs will you need to catch to fully power the village. Describe each step in your thought process.

## Coding Sample
Create a real-time polling application similar to the poll widget on our site (examples here and here). 

The application should support the tracking of votes in a poll or polls, and update a corresponding front-end representation of the related poll in real time. Give consideration to how information is stored, updated, and displayed. Data should be persistent. Add any useful features or web design practices you think would make it your own.

Bonus: Enthusiastic applicants are encouraged to show us what else you know. Examples of this could be; orchestrating your application in Docker, unit test coverage, or simply just a really good README.md.
